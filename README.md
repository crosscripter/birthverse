### How it Works!

this is your Birth Date Scripture

#### Example
For a birthday like `12/20/1985`:
`12+20=32`
`1+9+8+5=23`

Returns a list of Bible verses with the chapter `32` (sum of month and day)` and verse `23` (sum of year digits):

> 2 Chronicles 32:23 KJV â€” And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
